# LIVE SCOREBOARD LIBRARY

A simple, in-memory, test-driven TypeScript library for managing live football match scores â€” designed as part of a technical coding assessment. Supports live updates, summary listing by score and recency, and ensures clean OOP design with SOLID principles.

## Task Summary

You are building a **Live Scoreboard** library that supports:

1. Starting a new match (`0â€“0` by default)
2. Updating match scores (absolute values)
3. Finishing/removing a match from the scoreboard
4. Retrieving a **sorted** summary:
   - First by **total score (high â†’ low)**
   - Then by **start time (most recent first)**

### ðŸ“‹ Example Output Summary
If the following matches and scores exist:

```

Mexico 0 - Canada 5
Spain 10 - Brazil 2
Germany 2 - France 2
Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
Argentina 3 - Australia 1

```

Then the sorted summary should return:

1. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6  
2. Spain 10 - Brazil 2  
3. Mexico 0 - Canada 5  
4. Argentina 3 - Australia 1  
5. Germany 2 - France 2
